# The Clive Mind \[Abandoned :(\]

Let me start off by saying this was an educational project that never got finished and I decided not to because I lost interest. I wanted to learn how to construct neural networks and divide the work with MPI. I went off the deepend trying to make a live webserver to graph the training status and a chess solver... The initial goal was only to learn about neural networks and MPI, which the project achieved!

This is a cluster of 20 Dell Optiplex 755's...

I saw a surpluss posting for these computers from a local high school and instantly jumped in the auction. 

The MPI-ness of the project is plitting up the batches to different computers in the cluster in parallel and then collect the results.
